                    One of the biggest questions a business owner will have about the process of commercial roof installation is, “how long will it take?” The answer depends on a variety of factors. Today we’ll go over the general steps of commercial roofing services and help you understand the process. The installation of a commercial roof is a complex process that requires the expertise of experienced professionals; no two commercial properties are the same, so therefore no two projects are the same. This post will provide a general overview of what to expect when you call on a <a href="https://naroofing.com/commercial-roofing-contractors-atlanta-ga/">commercial roofing contractor</a> to install a new roof.

                    Structure Inspection
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first step in the process is inspecting your existing roofing system, both inside and out. This is to uncover any structural damage that may have occurred because of damage to the roof. If the structure’s interior has been damaged, your roof may need more intensive repairs; a roof built on a shaky foundation won’t last. The commercial roofing contractors will check on the integrity of your existing roof’s membrane, flashing, and insulation, determining whether any of it can be salvaged.
                </p>
                <div class="two-col">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The contractors will also inspect your roof to identify any areas that need specific attention; when you call for a commercial roof replacement, you very well might find that you only need some repairs! Once your roof has been inspected, you’ll get an estimate on the cost of installation and labor. This quote will generally include an estimated timeline for the project as well; this will vary based on the amount of work needed and the scale of the roofing project. Larger or greatly-damaged roofs will take longer. If you have any questions or concerns about the project, now is an excellent time to bring them up to your commercial roofer.

                    Deck Inspection
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Next, the roof deck is inspected for any signs of water damage or rot. If your roof deck is in good condition, the construction can proceed. However, if the deck is damaged, it will need repairs, adding to the repair timeline. This is likely to happen if your roof has been leaking; if you noticed water entering your business through the roof, it means the deck has been compromised in some way. Many people don’t think about their roof until it starts leaking, so this could be more likely than you think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the roof deck is repaired, a new layer of insulation is installed. The insulation helps to keep the building cooler in summer and warmer in winter, reducing energy costs.

                    Clearing the Existing Roof
                </h2>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first step of construction in a commercial roofing project is to remove the old roofing material and any damaged insulation. Depending on the extent of damage to your existing roof, this may be a simple repair job or a complete tear-off and replacement. If you’re replacing the entire roof, this process will naturally take longer than a partial replacement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this stage, the roofers will need to reserve an area on the ground to keep the torn-off materials and prepare the new ones. This may mean that your customers and employees need to park farther away from your business than usual, so make sure everyone is aware of the impending construction.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Finally, the contractors will install the new roofing material. The process usually takes several days to complete, but the results are well worth the effort. Depending on the type of roof being installed, as well as the scale, this step may take days or weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A strong and durable roof is essential for any commercial building, and installing a new roof is a great way to ensure that your property is protected from the elements. That’s why it’s so important that your roof is installed correctly; you wouldn’t want a rush job. It can take a while, but it’s all in pursuit of a solid and dependable roofing system.

                    Cleanup
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following the new installation, an inspector will inspect the roof to ensure it’s up to code. Once the roof evaluation is completed, the contractors can wrap up. The contractors will then clean up after themselves, ensuring minimal impact on your business. The roofing construction process frequently requires that you, your employees, and your customers park somewhere else or otherwise disrupt your business’s routine. Cleanup after the job is done is an integral part of complete roof services; customer satisfaction is a part of the process too!

                    What About the Weather?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we’ve already covered, many, many factors determine how long your construction project will take. Another very important factor is the weather. Rain, snow, and high winds can delay a roofing project, so keep an eye on the weather forecast. Your commercial roof contractor will keep in touch with you regarding any changes in the timeline resulting from poor weather. The safety of the construction team is a top priority, and being up on a roof during inclement weather can be very dangerous.
